cardinal_rlib
=============

By Rudolf Cardinal (rudolf@pobox.com).

This is an inelegant bunch of files containing miscellaneous code for use with
R and Stan.

You can source the latest version from Github. For example, to "source" the
``miscstat.R`` file from R, you can do this:

.. code-block:: R

    source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RudolfCardinal/rlib/master/miscstat.R")

and a copy should also be at https://egret.psychol.cam.ac.uk/rlib, as in:

.. code-block:: R

    source("https://egret.psychol.cam.ac.uk/rlib/miscstat.R")

Clearly these should be built into a proper R package at some stage.
